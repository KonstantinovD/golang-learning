# golang-learning
This project is used for learning golang.

NOTE: All the content in folders with '_sample[0-9][0-9]_' pattern is duplicated inside the _GO_TUTORIAL_ folder. It is impossible to keep multiple _.go_ files inside the single folder due to the main functions conflicts, so, sources could be run only inside the single folder, such as _sample01_, _sample02_, etc.  
To renew your knowledges about golang please use _GO_TUTORIAL_ folder.
